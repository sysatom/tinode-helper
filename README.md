## Building

The app uses Tauri for bundling and creating the tray, while the frontend is written with Nextjs and Typescript.

`yarn dev`

Runs just the Frontend Nextjs site, so you should be able to see it in the browser

`yarn tauri dev`

Makes it into a system tray

`yarn build` and `yarn tauri build`

Build the app for browser and desktop respectively
